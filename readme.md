# Chunking Interference Experiment

The experiment was designed to test for the interdependency of planning of elements within an observed and induced chunk in a behavioral experiment.
In some random trials, at a specified position, a digit would randomly change. The change would happen at either locations 5, 7, 9 of the sequence.

Participants were divided into two groups, each trained on four sequences with different chunking patterns adopted from A. Yokoi et al. 2019.

The chunking pattern were induced with the mean of an asychronous moving window. When the whole chunk has been performed, the next window would appear.

The chunking pattern were either '2333' or '3332' grouping each 2 or 3 digit together as chunks exactly as A. Yokoi et al. 2019.

The inter trial intervals were set to 3000ms. Subjects performed the task with their right hand. A total number of six subjects participated in the pilot.

The whole task was performed in one session, consisting of 10 blocks, 5 blocks of training with asynchronous moving window. The aim was to train the subjects to perform the sequence with the specified chunks.
In the rest 5 blocks, subjects were tested on the whole sequence (the whole sequence being visible to them) an were asked to perform as quickly and accurately as possible.
The purtubration, i.e. change of a digit randomly at either positions 5, 7, or 9, would happen at this phase.

Results of the analysis shows a chunking pattern as expected in the trainig phase. But in the test phase, they abandoned the expected chunking pattern, resulting in the failure of the task.

**It was important for the analysis to only select unbiased presses to include. Which are the presses that were within-chunk for one group, and between-chunk for the other group.**
